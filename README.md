# UlamRandomizer

AnUlam
An application designed for the indecisives. (Ma ano ulam?)

AnUlam accepts ulam as it's main data, stores it in a list and can be updated or remove ulam if unwanted.

Future Plans:
- Create a database that holds all known ulam entered by users.
- Create a swipe-right,swipe-left interface as the main factor in suggesting ulams.
- Filter ulams by categories (Nation of origin, taste (sweet, salty, sour etc.), difficulty, and other possible filters (vegan-friendly, halal etc.))
- When confirming, present a list of ingredients as well as instructions in cooking the dish (integrating an AI model to generate) and connect the list of ingredients to a 3rd party delivery-grocery app (foodpanda, grab etc.) to easily order ingredients online.
